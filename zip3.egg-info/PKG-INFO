Description: # Zip3
        
        Select a directory in your S3 bucket, generate a ZIP archive out of it, and save the ZIP on a destination of your choice in your S3 bucket.
        
        ## How it works
        
        * Everything is kept in memory throughout the whole process; no temporary files are created
        * A simple interface: call `Zip3.generate(input_directory, output_key)` (where `input_directory` is the directory in S3 that you want to ZIP, and `output_key` is where you want the newly-generated ZIP to get saved) and you're good to go!
        
        ## How to use it
        
        ```python
        import boto3
        from zip3 import Zip3
        
        # Set up connection to S3
        conn = boto3.resource("s3", region_name="eu-west-2")
        # Instantiate Zip3 with your S3 bucket
        Z3 = Zip3(conn, s3_bucket=bucket_name)
        output_key = "test_folder/archive2.zip"
        input_directory = "test_folder"
        # Generate ZIP and save it on S3
        Z3.generate(input_directory, output_key)
        ```
